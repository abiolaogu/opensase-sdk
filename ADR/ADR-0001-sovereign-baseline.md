# ADR-0001: Sovereign Baseline Adoption

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The ecosystem requires a consistent cloud-native baseline across multiple repositories.

## Decision
Adopt Apache Pulsar for eventing, Quickwit for search/log indexing, and Docs-as-Code controls.

## Consequences
Repositories gain a shared operational model, stronger observability contracts, and consistent compliance evidence paths.
